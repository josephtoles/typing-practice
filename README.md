# Typing Practice

This is a simple CLI tool to improve your typing speed. The Lisp and Python
versions are basically the same.

To use this program, run it in a shell with a Lisp or Python interpreter, as
appropriate. You will be prompted with a sting of characters. Type them back to
the program and then press Enter.
